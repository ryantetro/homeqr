# Chrome Web Store Listing Content for HomeQR

## Description (16,000 character limit)

```
Turn every yard sign, flyer, and social media post into a lead-generating machine with HomeQR — the smart QR code solution built specifically for real estate agents.

**THE PROBLEM:**
When you share property listings on Zillow or Realtor.com, you lose valuable buyer information. You can't track who viewed your listings, where they came from, or capture their contact details. Unrepresented buyers slip away, and you have no way to measure your marketing ROI.

**THE SOLUTION:**
HomeQR generates unique, branded QR codes for each property listing. When buyers scan your QR code, they're taken to a professional microsite (not Zillow) where they can view property details and submit their contact information. You capture every lead and track exactly where it came from.

**KEY FEATURES:**

- Visit any property listing on Zillow, Realtor.com, or other MLS sites
- Click the HomeQR extension icon

- No manual data entry required

📱 **Branded Property Microsites**
- Each QR code links to a beautiful, mobile-optimized property page
- Features your branding, photo, and contact information
- Professional presentation that builds trust with potential buyers
- Shareable links you can use in emails, texts, or social media
